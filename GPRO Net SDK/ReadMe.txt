To play:
Blue player makes the first move
The selected tile is highlighted as cyan, and the selected piece in green
Use the arrow keys to move. Enter to select a piece and then enter again to move.
If you selected a piece that has a possible jump (including multiple jumps), it has to jump.

Note:
Using enter causes an issue with windows and how the command window handles things.
As such, one may notice that the chat is a bit weird in a room after a lot of moves have been made. To fix, just spam a few messages until the input clears.
